A GUI countdown timer written in Python using the Tkinter framework.

The timer has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with the following versions of Python.
- Python 2.7.6
- Python 3.5.2
- Python 3.4.3

## Features
- Add multiple timers
- Add labels to each timer
- Simple scrolling to increase the value of each timer.

## Execution
As simple as:

```
python timer.py
```

## Known Issues
- Need to build in time correction (ticker might be off by a few miliseconds, and that adds up)
